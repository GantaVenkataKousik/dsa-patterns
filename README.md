# DSA Patterns

## Overview

The `dsa_patterns` repository is a collection of important Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, focusing on the various patterns that emerge from solving these challenges. While we tackle numerous DSA problems, it's crucial to identify the underlying patterns that can help us efficiently approach similar problems in the future.

### Purpose

As we work through these DSA challenges, we'll compile a list of significant patterns and their associated sub-patterns. This will not only aid in our revision process but also enhance our problem-solving skills by recognizing common themes across different problems. 

The goal is to identify multiple sub-patterns within a main pattern, which can be immensely beneficial when faced with new problems. By building this repository, we aim to create a valuable resource for both individual learning and collaborative study.

### Structure

- Each pattern will include multiple problems that illustrate its application.
- Problems will be added continuously, and we encourage contributions to make this repository a comprehensive guide for mastering DSA.

### Conclusion

Ultimately, this repository serves as a long-term resource for revisiting key DSA patterns and improving our ability to solve related problems efficiently. Join us in this journey to deepen our understanding of data structures and algorithms!
