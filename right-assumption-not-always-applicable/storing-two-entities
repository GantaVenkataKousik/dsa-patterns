we always have an right assumption

But it is not awalys applicable
so 

think for simple ones

1.
here I need to store the first index 
and last index 
in order to find the maximum distance possible 

so I thouhgt storing the indexes 
in an array
with key as the element

Map : element -> [first index , second index]

but instead we can also implement the same 
as 

element -> value

when the element first occurs we store that
that is enough becuase from
next 
whenever teh same element occurs
we find the 
diff and will update the maximum accordingly

Code:
manam enno dsa problems chestu untam kaani over a period manaki most imp andulo patterns 
nenu annii chesi naaku ippu malli revise avvalsi vastundi problem add chesina dani valla manakem use undaud 
ade pattern lo multiple problems identify chesina multiple sub patterns oka main pettern lo identify chesina
