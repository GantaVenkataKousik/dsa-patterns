Imginary next higher number can be replaced with -1


here the problem is to make teh array distinct
for this the intial assum[tion is to 
sort the array 
but they have asked for minimal opertions
which can't be garaunteed by sorting

now the main important thing 
is 
we traverse through the array
checks two adjacent elements

and then

change teh current element to -1
indicating that the next possibnle bigger number 
instead of finding the maximum number

Code:

class Solution {
    public static int makePerfect(int n, int[] arr) {
        // Arrays.sort(arr);
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            if(arr[i-1]==arr[i]){
                int diff=arr[i]-arr[i-1]+1;
                arr[i]=-1;
                ans++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
